# Background

This looks at the severe malaria legacy dataset from MORU

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load('RData/Data.R')
complete_cases = apply(m, 1, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) == 0
Leg_data = m[complete_cases,]
```


```{r}
# For the GAM modelling
library(mgcv)
```


# Full Model predicting death

```{r deathmodel}
mod_full = gam(outcome ~ s(HCT, AgeInYear,BUN, BD,  LPAR , SYS_BP_NUMERIC) + 
                  s(studyID, bs='re'),
                data=m[complete_cases,], family=binomial)
```

# Direct effect of anaemia on death
